A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

In this project: we go,
    -`Settings >> About phone >> build number (MIUI version)`
        then tap a few times and developer mode will be turned on.
    -`Settings >> search >> developer options >> USB debugging >> Install via USB`
       and it's ready to roll out the app

Idea:
add profile class (userName, email), this will also be backend for profile feature.
add login feature first. then we go for watchlist feature.
in watchlist feature, receive data from hive_services as _movieBox, loop through them to
get the poster and stuff from tmdb
